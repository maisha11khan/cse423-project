Game Setup

Buggy Movement & Controls

Drive the buggy using the WASD keys, with smooth acceleration, deceleration, and rotation.

The camera follows the buggy for a more immersive racing experience.

Chasing Enemy Cars

Five AI-controlled enemy cars will continuously chase the player.

Collisions between the player and enemies are resolved to keep the action smooth.

Missile Firing

Players can shoot curving missiles at enemy cars using the mouse and spacebar.

Dynamic Sand Dunes

The sand dunes are constantly shifting, creating new challenges and terrain as players race.

Fuel & Nitro Boosts

Press the UP key to activate nitro boosts for extra speed.

Fuel decreases as the player uses boosts, and the fuel bar shows the remaining fuel.

Game Features

Checkpoints

Random checkpoints appear during the race. Players must reach all checkpoints within a certain amount of health and time.

To pass a checkpoint, players must defeat at least 3 enemy cars.

Time Pressure Mode

A global timer counts down throughout the game. Each checkpoint adds extra time.

Running out of time means defeat.

Fake Ghost Cars

Encounter ghost cars that flicker and disappear, adding an unpredictable visual challenge.

Players can spawn up to 2 ghost cars that move randomly and shrink or expand before disappearing.

Enemy Behavior

When ghost cars are present, enemy cars ignore the player and chase the nearest ghost.

Once ghosts vanish, enemy cars return to targeting the player.

Repair Drones

Random repair drones appear. When the player reaches one, it repairs damage and slowly restores fuel.

The drones appear as floating spheres with rotating rings, changing color when active.

HP Healers

HP healers are one-time use items that help restore health with a cooldown after use.

Cheat Mode (C key)

Infinite Fuel & Nitro: Fuel never decreases, and boosts can be used endlessly.

Missile Auto-Homing: Missiles always curve towards the nearest enemy, and enemy missiles cannot hit the player.

Invincibility: The player cannot take crash damage.

Laying Bombs

Players can collect up to 3 bombs to destroy the two closest enemies.

Bombs reset after passing each checkpoint and respawn after the next checkpoint.

Environmental Hazards

Player Shrinks: The player can shrink to the size of a toy car.

Speed Reduction: Driving through sand pits slows down the buggy as if it's driving through thick mud.

Visual Feedback: Dark circles pulse to show sinking sand and the terrain becomes darker.

Recovery: After escaping the sand pit, the player gradually recovers, returning to normal size over time.

Camera

Press F for first-person view.

In first-person mode, pressing M slows down enemy movements and adds visual effects.

When the player is hit, the camera shakes for added impact.
